***INSTALLATION AND DEMO GUIDE***

There are two executable builds available in this repository. The "Full Game" build includes the entire game with the main menu and an opening cut scene. The "Level Generation" build includes only the infinite generation of levels.

To install our demo, the Unity Engine and HUB must be installed to run the game. The version we used to develop this demo was the Unity Editor 2020.3.30f1 (LTS). Once you have extracted the "WizardGame.zip" file, you can launch the game in the Unity HUB following these steps:

1. Select Open in the projects tab
2. Choose the corresponding folder that the files were extracted to
3. Launch the demo!

After it has loaded the files, the scene should show the camera for the game. The game can be started by selecting the play button above the gameplay area, launching the demo in that window.

In this demo, the player can be moved using the arrow keys (if you cannot move, try clicking on the game screen once having pressed play). There will be objects and enemies that limit your movement, and making contact with an enemy will start a battle. The objective for the player is to reach the top right corner of the level to advance to the next. 

Levels will generate endlessly until you are defeated!

In combat, the player will see a dialogue box to notify them of events, along with two buttons. The "attack" button will allow the player to slap their opponent and deal damage. The "spell" button will show the player some spells they can use in combat, for both attacking and healing. 

The player and enemy have their name and health displayed in their unique "HUD's". If the player wins a battle, they will be returned to the game. If they lose, they are sent to the starting menu for a new game.

We have included a sound manager with the game (that plays only the best music) that is instantiated once the level has been loaded.

We have a small start menu and intro that can be activated by selecting the "start" button.

There is a pause menu that can be activated by pressing the escape key. From there the player can return to the game by pressing escape once more, return to the start menu, or restart the game. 

All artwork is not our own, but are available to be used freely.
